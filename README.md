# Loan Dashboard â€“ React + MUI + TypeScript

- Displays a list of **mock loan records** (generated locally).
- **Filtering** by:
  - Applicant name (search)
  - Loan status (Approved, Pending, Rejected)
- **Server-style pagination** with large dataset handling.
- **Loading** and **error states** are handled.
- Uses **MUI DataGrid** for table rendering.
- Modular components:
  - `LoanTable`: Reusable table view component
  - `LoanFilter`: Reusable filter bar with dropdown and text input

npm install
npm start
